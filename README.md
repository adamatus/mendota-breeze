mendota-breeze
==============

As a wind-junky (sailer/kiter/windersurfer), I'm always interested in the current wind conditions.
For me, that's the wind on Lake Mendota in Madison, WI.  The Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC)
and Atmospheric and Osceanic Sciences (AOC) department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison maintain 
several instruments that measure the current weather and wind in the area.  This data is freely provided 
at http://metobs.ssec.wisc.edu/buoy/

I wanted a quicklook summary of the recent conditions, so I coded up a project using d3.js to display data pulled
and summarized from the AOS instruments.  You can check it out here: http://wind.riggall.info
